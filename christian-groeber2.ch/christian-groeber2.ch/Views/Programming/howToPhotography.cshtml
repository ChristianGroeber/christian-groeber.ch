    <h2>My very first Website</h2>
    <h4 id="subtitle">
        This is my very first website.<br />
        I created it during my first year of IMS and it is mostly static because I didn't know any scripting language yet. <br />
        I spent many hours working on this page and, even though it is a very simple page and nothing overly impressive I am still
        very proud of it.<br />
    </h4>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed learning how to create websites so I decided to make one for myself about my hobby photography.<br />
        I spent many, many hours on it, trying to also somehow implement a Layout (I had no idea MVC and Razor existed back then)
        and also making it look nice on mobile and on PC and making it bilangual.
        I had even come up with a new, revolutionary naming system.<br /><br />
        On the right side of the web page I had a small "news" segment which I wanted to keep updated, sort of like a small blog.
        The Problem there was that this segment had to be visible from all pages. It took me very long to find this but I had finally
        found a bit of JavaScript that would enable me to get any HTML site on the page with just one line of code.<br />
        But of course, that sounds way too good to be true. Don't get me wrong, it does work, but it messes up the CSS really bad.
        I had to test around and see if I could get it back to look properly for ages but I eventually did it.<br />
        By that time I had definitely seen enough of CSS so I just went ahead and created all the pages from scratch to make it look
        good on Mobile

    <div class="row">
        <img class="col-sm-4" src="~/Content/img/projects/howToPhotography/web1.PNG" />
        <img class="col-sm-4" src="~/Content/img/projects/howToPhotography/long-arrow-right.png" />
        <img class="col-sm-4" src="~/Content/img/projects/howToPhotography/web2.PNG" />
    </div>

    <h3 id="gallery">Gallery</h3>
    <p>
        Since that was a photography website I had to build a gallery. Luckily, I managed to find a website that offered a number of
        all-CSS gallery templates. I did some modification to it to make it look the way I wanted it to.<br />
        In the end, it looked something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="~/Content/img/Projects/howToPhotography/photo-gallery.PNG" />
    <p>
        Although it isn't the most fancy gallery of them all out there, it did the job.<br />
        The only downside was, it wasn't too developer-friendly, meaning it wasn't too easy adding new pictures in post.<br />
        On my website <a class="styled" href="@Url.Action("ParisBlog", "Programming")">about my stay in Paris</a> I came up with a new system that used the power 
        of PHP to go through all the files in a certain directory and put the pictures on the site.
