    <h2>My very first Website</h2>
    <h3>
        This is my very first website.<br />
        I created it during my first year of IMS and it is mostly static because I didn't know any scripting language yet. <br />
        I spent many hours working on this page and, even though it is a very simple page and nothing overly impressive I am still
        very proud of it.<br />

        I really enjoyed learning how to create websites so I decided to make one for myself about my hobby photography.<br />
        I spent many, many hours on it, trying to also somehow implement a Layout (I had no idea MVC and Razor existed back then)
        and also making it look nice on mobile and on PC and making it bilangual.
        I had even come up with a new, revolutionary naming system.<br /><br />
        On the right side of the web page I had a small "news" segment which I wanted to keep updated, sort of like a small blog.
        The Problem there was that this segment had to be visible from all pages. It took me very long to find this but I had finally
        found a bit of JavaScript that would enable me to get any HTML site on the page with just one line of code.<br />
        But of course, that sounds way too good to be true. Don't get me wrong, it does work, but it messes up the CSS really bad.
        I had to test around and see if I could get it back to look properly for ages but I eventually did it.<br />
        By that time I had definitely seen enough of CSS so I just went ahead and created all the pages from scratch to make it look
        good on Mobile
