                        After my year in Ireland I started my apprenticeship which I quickly realized wasn't the right thing for me. <br />
                        During the first half year I started teaching myself Java and I soon after decided (February 2016) to quit
                        the apprenticeship and start at IMS (IT-School). During the next half year I prepared myself for the acceptance exam which would
                        take place in May of the same year. During that time I worked temporarily at Lyreco, an office supplies company.

                        During Bezirksschule I was, like all other students in my class, looking for an apprenticeship.
                        All I knew was that I never wanted to return to school since school had left me pretty scared. I did, however,
                        love crafts so I thought I'd find a job where I could work with my hands. Since it took me quite some time to find something
                        I liked doing and was good at my mother talked to some of her friends and one told her I should go to Ireland where they have friends.
                        In autumn 2013 we went to visit them and I really enjoyed it there and I decided I wanted to go there for one year after school.
                        Of course I had to have my apprenticeship until then because otherwise I would have to travel back and forth for job interviews.<br />
                        Luckily I found something in spring 2014 and I immediately got the job. It was an apprenticeship as "Fahrzeugschlosser"
                        (The guys that repare trucks and stuff like that.)<br />
                        So from <b>August 2014 to July 2015</b> I was in Ireland, helping out on their farm and learning english.

                        I've been into computers and programming for quite some time now, ever since I got a LEGO Mindstorms I was hooked.<br />
                        During my apprenticeship I started teaching myself Java (I had even bought myself a book, so that should show how
                        invested I was) and shortly after I quit my apprenticeship alltogether in order to attend IMS.<br />
                        I absolutely love learning about new technologies, I even once tried to tackle AI but I fear that was a little bit over the top.<br />
                        At the moment I am learning to create Websites using Django. I first heard about Django from another firm that used this framework.
                        Hoping I could enhance my chances at getting hired I learned the basics of Django and asolutely loved it. <br />
                        Just before 2018 ended I was asked by a friend I had met during my stay in Paris asked me if I could program a kickstarter like
                        website for them and of course I said yes. <br /><br />
                        Other than that am I maintaining the website for <a href="http://www.meintrainingsplan.ch">meintrainingsplan.ch</a>. The site was
                        built by chili solutions using Umbraco cms and now I'm updating the site whenever ther's something to update.<br />
                        I mainly created the <a href="http://www.meintrainingsplan.ch/finde-deinen-coach">find your coach</a> page.
